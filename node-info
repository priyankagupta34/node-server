Node.js and chrome complies javascript over v8 engine which is written in c++

localstorage.getItem.... interestingly they are not javascript but is implemented by chrome's runtime which later c++ code executes behind scene, 
so basically they are c++ code.
Even in node, we use fs.readfile or os.platform, they too are c++ code not javascript

in node we have global instead of window, and for document we have process in node as node dnt have DOM so document does not make sense

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it light weight and efficient. I/O means input output like a accessing file from disk
, or reading data from database, but here in node they are non blocking which means while suppose it is fetching code from database, other operations
will continue to work without interuption
